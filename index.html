<b>(ドラえもん)</b>
Doraemon is one of the most popular manga and anime series in Japan. The main character Doraemon is a cat-shaped robot who came from the future. It was created by the famous manga creator Fujiko F Fujio. It was serialized in monthly elementary school children’s magazines from 1969 and it is still running today.

The manga has become a TV anime in 1973. The first series lasted a half year, but they made another series in 1973 based on a new story called Doraemon Returns. Then another series started in 2005 and it has been continuing ever since.

The TV program lasts only 30 minutes, but Fujiko also wrote longer stories for the movies. The first movie ‘Nobita’s Dinosaur’ was made in 1980, and then 40 other movies were made based on long stories.

The manga was translated into many foreign languages and published in many countries. The anime also has been broadcast in many countries. So, it is loved by many people around the world.

<p><h3>Story of Doraemon</h3>
It all starts on a New Year’s Day, when Doraemon suddenly appears from the drawer of Nobita’s desk. Doraemon comes from the future, and is with Nobita’s great-great-grandson, Sewashi. He has a problem with heavy debt caused by the bankruptcy of Nobita’s company. Sewashi came from the 22nd century to see Nobita to change the future, and he brought Doraemon to look after him.

Nobita is an unmotivated and lazy elementary schoolboy. He is often bullied by Jaian who is the boss of the kids. Jaian has Suneo, a luck-pusher, in tow. Doraemon has a four-dimensional pocket in his belly and he takes out various secret gadgets to save Nobita in any crisis. But Nobita has a tendency to overuse the gadgets which creates a backlash. He likes Shizuka, a kind-hearted girl. They may get married in the future.
What is the reason why children have loved this manga for such a long time? I think it is the lovable appearance and character of Doraemon, as well as the sympathy they feel for Nobita.
